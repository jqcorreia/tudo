# TUDO
**T**UDO **U**niveral **D**esktop **O**perator  
**T**ransforming **U**ser-**D**evice **O**peration  
Everything (in Portuguese)  
Take a pick at the meaning.  

Desktop Omnibar. Type and launch stuff. Pretty simple.  
Semi-serious learning project.  
Meant to be used as a wristwatch. You want it there but you don't need to look at it all the time.  
Maybe just replace the concept of a top/bottom bar with the clock and stuff  

## Nice-to-haves
- As low latency as possible both in launching and in using
- Fast indexing
- Tray icons, interactable
- TOML configuration (with sane defaults)
- Extendable in Lua
- Minimal list of dependencies
    - SDL2 with `ttf` and `image`
